# Code Portfolio
**by Liisa Törmäkangas**

This is a portfolio of some selected pieces of code I have written since I started studying coding in January 2022.

## Code written by Python
These three code examples are written in a Helsinki Open University course *Advanced Course in Programming* during Autumn 2022.

### **Clock**
in directory: clock_python
>Clock was one of the course tasks for practicing the use of Pygame, an open-source library for developing multimedia applications using Python language. The task was just to create a watch dial to show the current time with hour, minute, and second hands. 

>The Clock code is quite simple and the application is very small overall. However, making this code to work has been one of the most memorable "victories" during my (yet very short) career in coding when struggling to solve difficult tasks. With this task also knowing the basics of trigonometry helped to solve how to set the end points of the clock hands.

**To run a Pygame application:**
- first install Pygame to your computer by running a command-line command:
```bash
pip3 install pygame
```
- then in your code editor, cd into the correct directory and run the code
### **Robot Game**
in directory: robogame_python
>This game - also exploiting Pygame - was the final project of the *Advanced Course in Programming*. The task was to create a game with a moving character collecting some things, and including a counter to show the progress in game.

**To run a Pygame application:**
- first install Pygame to your computer by running a command-line command:
```bash
pip3 install pygame
```
- then in your code editor, cd into the correct directory and run the code
- enjoy the fabulous game!!

### **Storage Application**
in directory: storageApp_python
>This application was an exam task of *Advanced Course in Programming* focused on object-oriented programming. The task was to create an application for handling a storage data: the app should ask user for the name of the data file, create this file, and use several different commands to add or remove items from the storage file, or to list the contents of the file.

## React JavaScript application
in directory: surveys_javascript
>This application for creating surveys and collecting and visualizing data from surveys was a project work on *Buutti JavaScript Trainee* course during June and July 2022. The project was originally a pair work done in co-operation with a course mate Tuomo Kurikka. The code presented here is modified and refactored since that, and in the present form, more than 90 % of the code is written by me. For example, the original project included a json.db for data storage, which I have later replaced by adding the backend part exploiting MongoDB.

The application is using following technologies and libraries:
- React and React router
- Axios for database calls
- Express.js for creating the backend with MongoDB
- React Bootstrap for creating UI styling
- Chart.js to include charts and visualizing data

To start the application from the command line, run:
```bash
npm start
```
